#CSP & HTML validation - PHP Library
###This is a PHP library which helps prevents CSFR attacks by removing event triggers, and script tags from HTMLDocuments
#####The purpose of this project, is to develop a universal library, which could be used to validate and sanitise HTML outputs, to eliminate security risks such as Global XSS attacks. This script should be used, where the target user is not protected (using OS versions such as android, upto v4.4, or other vulnerable browsers) 

#####This script, should be used in conjuction with CSP headers. The headers that we have used in our servers will be listed below, and should be used in your servers too.

### Usage
<?php

`use libs\security\script;`

`require_once 'script.php';`



> `$input = $_POST['html_content'];`

> `$output = script\sanitise($input);`
